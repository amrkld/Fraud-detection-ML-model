Fraud Detection machine learning model utilizes the "DecisionTreeClassifier" to identify fraudulent activities on an online payment app.

The data contains various features such as "type of payment," "old account balance," and "transaction amount." We have created plots to visualize the relationships between each of these features and the "fraudulent" or "non-fraudulent" label.

After deciding which features to use, we trained the model using these features and fine-tuned it to fit our data well. The model performed very well, with an accuracy close to 99% and a loss of less than 2%.
